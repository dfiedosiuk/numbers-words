= Kafka Streams
:toc:

Program for given arguments in command line (for example):
[source]
-n number -t text -o outNumber -p outText -m 10

takes numbers and words from topics number and text. Actions on messeges in topic text:

. Words to upper case letters

Actions on messeges in topic number:

. Multiplies positive numbers by a number given on command line +
. Adds “negative number: “ prefix to negative numbers

I made two topologies but for two streams but I do not know how to merge them in two topics. App could be spleted into two apps opperating each topic seperatly.
Each topology was seperated to do tests. No time no tests.
